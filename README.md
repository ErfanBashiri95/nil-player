## 🧠 Architecture Notes

- Uses a **custom fullscreen wrapper** that keeps controls + watermark visible  
- Auto-pause when focus is lost or capture detected  
- Dispatches a global event on progress updates (`nilplayer:progress-updated`)  
- Simple **Auth whitelist** (`allowedUsers.json`) for access control  
- Clean separation of UI / logic / data layers
